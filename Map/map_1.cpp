/*
There are also several other types of maps available in C++, such as:

std::unordered_map: An associative container that stores elements in an unordered way using a hash table. It provides constant-time average complexity for searching,
 inserting, and deleting elements.
std::multimap: Similar to std::map, but allows multiple elements with the same key.
std::unordered_multimap: Similar to std::unordered_map, but allows multiple elements with the same key.

/*
In C++, there are two types of set available in the standard library:

std::set: This is an ordered set, which means that the elements are stored in a specific order defined by a comparison function (by default, the < operator).
This type of set is implemented as a balanced binary search tree, typically a red-black tree.

std::unordered_set: This is an unordered set, which means that the elements are not stored in any particular order. This type of set is implemented as a hash
 table, where the elements are stored based on their hash values.

Both types of sets provide similar functionality, but they have different performance characteristics and are suited to different use cases.
